# Hash 

# 1. Direct Address Tables
    # An array that represents the dynamic set of a universe of elements
    # Each element(slot) corresponds to a key in the universe
    # The table can perform three functions: search, insert and delete 

# 2. Hash Table 
    # Capable of storing large amount of data
    # Uses a hash funciton h(k) to computer the slot from the key

# 3. Collision
    # When two keys hash to the same slot, the situation is called a collions
    # A "random"-looking hash function can minimize the number of collions
