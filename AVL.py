# AVL Tree
# 1. Balanced 
#     - Binary search trees support insert, delete, min, max, next_Large and next_Smaller
#     in O(h) time, where h is the height of the tree 
#     - h is between log(n) and n
#     - Balanced BST maintains h = O(log(n)) => all operations run at O(log(n)) time

# 2. AVL trees
#     - for every node, require heights of left and right children to differ by at most +- 1
#     - treat nill tree as height -1
#     - each node stores its height
