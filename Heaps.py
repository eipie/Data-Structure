# Priority Que
# Implements a set S of elements, each of the elements associated with a key

# Some functions of a priority que
# Insert(S, x): insert element x into S
# Max(S): return element of S with the largest key
# Extract(S): return element of S with the largest key and remove it
# Increase Key(S, x, k): increase the value of x's key to new value k 

# Heaps
# An array visualized an nearly complete binary tree

# Heaps on a tree
    # root of the tree: first element (i = 1)
    # parent(i) = i / 2
    # left(i) = 2i, right(i) = 2i + 1
# Max heap property
    # the key of a node is greater or equal to the keys of its children
# Min heap property
    # the key ofa node is less or equal to the keys of its children
